      My girlfriend and I adopted Apollo last year.
      We have no idea what kinds of breeds he has.
      He is a sweet and needy boy, and we both adore him.
      He loves to rip open boxes and take toys from Bramble.

    We adopted Bramble a year and a half ago.
    She is part boxer, german shepard, and a few others.
    She loves to swim more than life itself, and she will be
    your best friend if you give her some food.
